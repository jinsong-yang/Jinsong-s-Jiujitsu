# Jiujitsu-Concepts
Descrisble the vital concepts via science
## What is this project about?
This project is trying to clear some baisc concepts of jiujitsu with some physical thoughts.
## How could this project help me?
Normally, the jiujitsu techniques are shared through vedios and gym. In both ways, the techniques are flat, rookies can not see the architecture of jiujitsu system but just some isolated skills. 
That is the reason we try to build the mindset and structure for most rookies. The thoughts and mind may not be just suit you, but it will help you to clear your thoughts and build your own system.
## Why would we do this?
Every belt with colour starts from rookies. We want to share our thinking to help people. Every grappler with some revoluation can truly contribute to the jiujitsu world.
## How could we do this?
We want you to join us to build it together. PLZ send your e-mail to yaungqingdi@126.com .
